# ğŸ’¡ Local Tuya through ESP32 (S3) ğŸ’¡

I trying to manipulate tuya smart bulb by ESP32 (S3) micro-controller. Written in C++ (early for older ESP, due limitations). 

Current or future task - make better, smarter and faster implementation.

### Why?

I would to make almost network or internet independent smart home. Currently, our Wi-Fi connection not so stable.
